# Start Page Clone

# Overview

This is an attempt to clone [Buffer's Start Page product](https://buffer.com/start-page). Serves as a personal execise in learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

# Backend (GraphQL)

## How to run

```sh
# provided you've already cloned and are in the project folder.
cd backend

npm install
npm run dev
# check http://localhost:4000/
```

# Frontend (React)

## How to run

```sh
# provided you've already cloned and are in the project folder.
cd frontend

npm install
npm run dev
# check http://localhost:3000/
```

**NOTE**: frontend will still work without a backend, it will revert to using the static data in the code (for now).
